# Kickstarter_use_analysis
This repo contains an analysis of kickstarter use. This was done as a part of MSU Data Bootcamp. 

The file 'Auspicious_Use_Patterns_report.docx' is a word document report that explains the findings of my analysis into the Kickstarter Data. 

The file 'Auspcicious_Use_Patterns_Spreadsheet.xlsx' is the excel spreadsheet containing the data set, pivot tables and charts that I used to write this report and form conclusions. 

Within the file 'Auspcicious_Use_Patterns_Spreadsheet.xlsx' you will find several tabs - here is an explanation of the information contained within each. 

'Kickstarter Data' This is the original dataset for the analysis with several new fields added - "Percent Funded", "Avg Donation", "category", "subcategory", "Start Date", "End Date"

'Contry Stats' contains a pivot table I created to analyze use by country and two stacked bar charts for display.

'Category Stats' contains a pivot table I used to analyze use by category.

'Subcategory Stats' contains a pivot table I used to analyze by subcategory. Both category sheets contain two stacked bar charts for display purposes, which are filterable by country (and category in the subcategory sheet).

'Time Stats' contains a pivot table and two stacked bar charts for analysis of campaigns based on start date. These are fliterable by category and years. 

'Goal Analysis' contains a tally of successful, failed and cancelled campaigns implemented using "countifs" functions. I then used these to calculate percentages of each, and displayed findings in a line chart. 

'Stats analysis' is a descriptive statistical analysis of the number of backers campaigns had from each state category. These functions call on data from 'subsheet for stats analysis'.

'Subsheet for stats analysis' - is a copy of the relevant parts of the data set, which I sorted by state in order to make the stats analysis easier. The cell addreses of campaigns in different states are found written out here as well.

'Stats Pivot' is a recalculation of some of the stats from 'stats analysis' using a pivot table method in order to check my figures in the stats analysis.
